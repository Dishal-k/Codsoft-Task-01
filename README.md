CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

Task 1: Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

The chatbot function starts by greeting the user. It enters an infinite loop where it waits for user input. The user input is converted to lowercase and stripped of any leading or trailing spaces to standardize the input for easier comparison. The bot checks if the user input matches any of the predefined queries using if-else statements

This is a very basic example to get you started with building chatbots. You can expand its capabilities by adding more sophisticated natural language processing techniques and integrating it with external APIs for more dynamic responses.
